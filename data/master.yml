    description: This course will provide students with a basic understanding of privacy risks,
      the most common technologies to tackle them and the human factors shaping their design. 
      The course will analyze the adversary models and evaluation metrics underlying the design 
      of privacy-enhancing technologies.

    id: two 
    description:  Students will gain practical, research-oriented knowledge about usable security
     and privacy- 1) from the technical side, by programming an application for usable security, 
     or 2) from the human behavior research side, through the design and pretest of a user study. 
    coursecontent:
      - item: Students will gain an appreciation for the importance of usable security and privacy
      - item: Students will learn about the history of the field and main research areas and challenges
      - item: Students will are able to apply methodologies to conduct user research in security and privacy
