    description: Students taking this lecture will gain practical knowledge about usable security and privacy-<br>
      <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1) from the technical side, by programming an application for usable security, or 
      <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2) from the human behavior research side, through the design and pretest of 
      a user study.
      <br><br>Students will work alone or in small teams to develop an usable security concept with dedicated 
      mentorship along the way. At the end, they will submit a technical report or paper and present their 
      application or study design and preliminary results in a conference-style format.
